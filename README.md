##Â What is a RAG ? 
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation process is an augmentation of the output of an LLM's response to a prompt, provided with specific data related to the subject we want to learn about. The core concept is to provide more context alongside a user's input to help the model answer with augmented accuracy.
